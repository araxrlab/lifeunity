# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.1.3] - 2020-04-13
### New
- Adding the API updater files required to update from `XRReferencePoint*` to `XRAnchor*`.
- Adding new methods to the `XRCameraSubsystem` to query the list of enabled & disabled material keywords for the shader.

## [3.0.2] - 2020-03-18
### Fixes
- Fixed "X" (remove reference image) icon in the `XRReferenceImageLibrary` inspector.

## [3.0.0] - 2019-11-05
### Breaking changes
- Renaming the concept of `Reference Points` to `Anchors`. The Unity script updater should convert any references to `XRReferencePointSubsystem`, `XRReferencePoint`, and `XRReferencePointSubsystemDescriptor` the next time the project is loaded into the Editor.

## [3.0.0-preview.4] - 2019-10-22
### New
- Change `TrySetFocusMode` to a property called `focusMode`, enabling providers to implement a getter as well as a setter.
- Added `classification` on `BoundedPlane` which provides
contextual information such as `Floor`, `Wall`, `Ceiling`.

### Fixes
- [`XRCameraImagePlane.ToString()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRCameraImagePlane.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARSubsystems_XRCameraImagePlane_ToString) invoked `NativeArray.ToString()` to build its string, which produced a string with a lot of irrelevant information. Now, it just displays the length of the array, row stride, and pixel stride of the plane.

## [3.0.0-preview.3] - 2019-09-26
### New
- Added an input device layout for the [Input System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem), for use by individual providers.

### Breaking Changes
- Updated the interface for all subsystems to apply a consistent pattern across all subsystems. This affects subsystem implementations (such as ARCore and ARKit) but should not affect consumers of those subsystems.
- Removed `supported` property on the `XRFaceSubsystem`. Providers (such as ARKit) are expected not to register themselves if they are not supported.
- Removed `supported` property on the `XREnvironmentProbeSubsystem`. Providers (such as ARKit) are expected not to register themselves if they are not supported.

## [3.0.0-preview.2] - 2019-09-05
- Updated package version to 3.0.0-preview.2 for consistency with other AR-related packages.

## [3.0.0-preview.1] - 2019-08-21
### New
- Add support for reference image libraries that are modifiable at runtime. For platforms that support it, this allows you to add new reference images at runtime.

## [2.2.0-preview.4] - 2019-07-30
### New
- Add support for eye tracking.
- Added an [XRParticipantSubsystem](../manual/participant-subsystem.html) which can track users in a multi-user collaborative session.
- Add support for exposure duration
- Add support for exposure offset
- Add support for Lightweight Render Pipeline and Universal Render Pipeline.
- Add support for height scale estimatation for the 3D human body subsystem.

## [2.2.0-preview.3] - 2019-07-16
### New
- Add support for `NotTrackingReason`.
- Add support for getting the ambient light intensity in lumens.
- Add functionality to the `XRSessionSubsystem` to enable synchronizing the Unity frame with the AR session update. See `XRSessionSubsystem.matchFrameRate` and `XRSessionSubsystem.frameRate`.

### Fixes
- Fix `CameraFocusMode` handling in `XRCameraSubsystem`. This fixes an issue when running on a provider that does not set the default focus mode to `CameraFocusMode.Fixed`.

## [2.2.0-preview.2] - 2019-06-05
- Adding support for ARKit 3 functionality: Human pose estimation, human segmentation images, session collaboration, multiple face tracking, and tracking a face (with front camera) while in world tracking (with rear camera).

## [2.1.0-preview.2] - 2019-05-16
### Fixes
- Fix documentation links.

## [2.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-05-06
### New
- Add an image tracking subsystem.
- Add an environment probe subsystem.
- Add a face tracking subystem.
- Add an object tracking subsystem for detecting previously scanned 3D objects.

## [2.0.1] - 2019-03-12
- 2019.2 verified release

## [1.0.0-preview.1] - 2019-01-14
- This is the first release of *Unity Package com.unity.xr.subsystems.
