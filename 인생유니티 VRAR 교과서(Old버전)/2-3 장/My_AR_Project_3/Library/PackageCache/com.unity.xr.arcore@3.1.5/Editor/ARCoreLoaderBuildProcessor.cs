    /// Custom configuration instances that are stored in EditorBuildSettings are not copied to the target build
    /// as they are considered unreferenced assets. In order to get them to the runtime side of things, they need
    /// to be serialized to the build app and deserialized at runtime. Previously this would be a manual process
    /// requiring the implementor to manually serialize to some location that can then be read from to deserialize
    /// at runtime. With the new PlayerSettings Preloaded Assets API we can now just add our asset to the preloaded
    /// list and have it be instantiated at app launch.
    ///
    /// Note that the preloaded assets are only notified with Awake, so anything you want or need to do with the
    /// asset after launch needs to be handled there.
