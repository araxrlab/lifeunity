# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.1.3] - 2020-04-13
### Fixes
- Fixed issue that broke the camera background rendering when URP post-processing was enabled on the AR camera.
- The documentation for the `ARFace` scripting API for accessing left eye, right eye, and fixation point incorrectly referred to a nullable value type, when in fact the returned type is a [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html). This has been fixed.
- Added script updater support for facilitating the rename of Reference Points to Anchors.
- Added `FormerlySerializedAs` to `ARAnchorManager.m_AnchorPrefab` field to preserve any prefab specified when it was the `ARReferencePointManager`.
- Patched a memory leak by destroying the camera textures when the camera manager is disabled.
- Eliminating shader compiler errors that started with Unity 2020.1 and that originate from the ARKit package.

## [3.0.1] - 2019-11-18
### Breaking changes
- Renaming the concept of `Reference Points` to `Anchors`. The Unity script updater should convert any references to `ARReferencePointManager`, `ARReferencePoint`, and `ARReferencePointsChangedEventArgs` the next time the project is loaded into the Editor.

### Fixes
- Removed references to LWRP from the documentation.

## [3.0.0-preview.6] - 2019-11-14

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue which could cause the background camera texture to stop functioning correctly on certain devices running OpenGLES3.
- Previously, when using LWRP or UniversalRP, the requested culling mode was ignored. This resulted in an incorrect culling mode when using the front facing camera with ARCore (e.g., during face detection). This has been fixed.

### Breaking Changes
- The following virtual methods on the `ARCameraBackground` have been removed:
  - `ConfigureLegacyRenderPipelineBackgroundRendering`
  - `TeardownLegacyRenderPipelineBackgroundRendering`

  Previously, `ConfigureLegacyRenderPipelineBackgroundRendering` configured a `CommandBuffer` and added the command buffer to the camera. If you had overriden this method previously, you can override the `legacyCameraEvents` property to specify the camera events which use the CommandBuffer, and `ConfigureLegacyCommandBuffer(CommandBuffer)` to configure the command buffer. There is no need to override `TeardownLegacyRenderPipelineBackgroundRendering` anymore because the `ARCameraBackground` remembers which `CameraEvent`s the buffer was added to so it can remove them later.

## [3.0.0-preview.4] - 2019-10-22
### New
- Querying the [`ARCameraManager`'s `focusMode`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARCameraManager.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARCameraManager_focusMode) will return the actual camera focus value rather than a cached value.
- Added `classification` property on `ARPlane` which may return contextual information about planes. See [PlaneClassification](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.PlaneClassification.html) for the list of all possible classifications.
- Added `supportsClassification` property to [XRPlaneSubsystemDescriptor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems.XRPlaneSubsystemDescriptor.html).
- Add getter for the current AR frame rate to the `ARSession`. See [`ARSession.frameRate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARSession.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARSession_frameRate).
- [`ARFace.supportedFaceCount`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARFaceManager.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARFaceManager_supportedFaceCount) would throw if face tracking was not supported. Now it returns 0.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the `ARSessionOrigin` which could produce incorrect behavior with non-identity transforms.
- [`ARPlane.center`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARPlane.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARPlane_center) was computed incorrectly (though the result was close to the correct answer). This has been fixed.

## [3.0.0-preview.3] - 2019-09-26
### New
- If ["match frame rate"](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@3.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARSession.html#UnityEngine_XR_ARFoundation_ARSession_matchFrameRate) is enabled, the `ARSession` now checks for changes to the recommended frame rate each frame.

### Breaking changes
- Some properties on `ARPointCloud` changed from `NativeArray`s to nullable `NativeSlice`s. See the [migration guide](../manual/migration-guide-2.md#point-clouds) for more details.
- The `ARFaceManager.supported` property has been removed. If face tracking is not supported, the manager's subsystem will be null. This was done for consistency as no other manager has this property. If a manager's subsystem is null after enabling the manager, that generally means the subsystem is not supported.

### Fixes
- Fixed a typo in [Face Tracking](../manual/face-manager.html) documentation which incorrectly referred to planes instead of faces. Also updated the screenshot of the ARFaceManager to reflect the "Maximum Face Count" field.

## [3.0.0-preview.2] - 2019-09-05
### Fixes
- Fix issue where having the camera clearFlags property set to Skybox would break background rendering.
- Fix issue where screen would flash green before the first camera frame was received.

### Improvements
- Converted dependency on Legacy Input Helpers package to optional dependency.  ARFoundation will continue to support the use of [TrackedPoseDriver](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/SpatialTracking.TrackedPoseDriver.html) and the `UnityEngine.SpatialTracking` namespace but there is no longer a dependency on that package.  ARFoundation can instead use the `ARTrackedPoseDriver` self-contained component to surface the device's pose.

## [3.0.0-preview.1] - 2019-08-21
### New
- Added support for eye tracking.
- Added support for [XRParticipantSubsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@3.0/manual/participant-subsystem.html), which can track other users in a multi-user collaborative session.
- Added support for exposure duration
- Added support for exposure offset
- Add support for Lightweight Render Pipeline and Universal Render Pipeline.
- Add support for height scale estimatation for the 3D human body subsystem.

### Improvements
- Update the Legacy Input Helpers package to 1.3.7. This has no impact on existing functionality in ARFoundation, but should help with compatibility when using other packages.
- Add `IEquatable` to `TrackableCollection`.
- Previously, the `ARTrackedImageManager` and `ARTrackedObjectManager` would throw an exception if enabled without a valid reference library. These managers no longer throw; now, they disable themselves. This makes it possible to add one of these managers at runtime, since Unity will automatically invoke `OnEnable` before you have a chance to set a valid reference library. If you create one of these managers at runtime, you will need to set a valid reference library and then re-enable it.

### Fixes
- Fixed the issue where native providers were not being reinstantiated after being destroyed when loading/reloading a new scene.

## [2.2.0-preview.3] - 2019-07-16
### New
- Added support for [XR Management](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.management@2.0/manual/index.html).
- Add support for `ARSession.notTrackingReason`.
- Add an option to synchronize the Unity frame with the AR session's update. See `ARSession.matchFrameRate`.
- Add an `ARMeshManager` to interface with the [`XRMeshSubsystem`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Experimental.XR.XRMeshSubsystem.html). This is useful for XR Plugins that can generate meshes at runtime.

### Changes
- Previously, a trackable manager's changed event (e.g., `ARPlaneSubsystem.planesChanged`) was invoked every frame even if nothing had changed. Now, it is only invoked on frames when a change has occurred.

## [2.2.0-preview.2] - 2019-06-05
- Adding support for ARKit 3 functionality: Human pose estimation, human segmentation images, session collaboration, multiple face tracking, and tracking a face (with front camera) while in world tracking (with rear camera).

## [2.1.0-preview.4] - 2019-06-03
### Improvements
- Added a convenience method `ARTrackableManager.SetTrackablesActive(bool)` which will call `SetActive` on each trackable's `GameObject`. This is useful, for example, to disable all `ARPlane`s after disabling the `ARPlaneManager`.
- Fix NativeArray handling when `ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS` is set. This fixes an issue when running ARFoundation in the Editor. This is not set in the Player, so it is not an issue when running on device.

## [2.1.0-preview.3] - 2019-05-22
### Fixes
- Fix documentation links.

## [2.1.0-preview.2] - 2019-05-07
### New
- Add support for image tracking (`XRImageTrackingSubsystem`).
- Add support for environment probes (`XREnvironmentProbeSubsystem`).
- Add support for face tracking (`XRFaceSubsystem`).
- Add support for object tracking (`XRObjectTrackingSubsystem`).

## [2.0.1] - 2019-03-05
## Changes
- See the [Migration Guide](Documentation~/migration-guide.md).

## [1.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-01-16
### Fixes
- Add dependency on Legacy Input Helpers, which were moved from Unity to a package in 2019.1.

## [1.0.0-preview.22] - 2018-12-13

- Fix package dependency

## [1.0.0-preview.21] - 2018-12-13

### New
- Added Face Tracking support:  `ARFaceManager`, `ARFace`, `ARFaceMeshVisualizer` and related scripts. See documentation for usage.

### Improvements
- Plane detection modes: Add ability to selectively enable detection for horizontal, vertical, or both types of planes. The `ARPlaneManager` includes a new setting, which defaults to both.
- Add support for setting the camera focus mode. Added a new component, `ARCameraOptions`, which lets you set the focus mode.

### Changes
- The light estimation option, which was previously on the `ARSession` component, has been moved to the new `ARCameraOptions` component.

## [1.0.0-preview.20] - 2018-11-06
### Improvements
- Support reference points reported without a corresponding `TryAddReferencePoint` call. This handles reference points that are added by some other means, e.g., loaded from a serialized session.

## [1.0.0-preview.19] - 2018-10-10
- Added support for `XRCameraExtensions` API to get the raw camera image data on the CPU. See the [manual documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@1.0/manual/cpu-camera-image.html) for more information.

## [1.0.0-preview.18] - 2018-09-13
### Fixes
- The `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer` did not disable its visible components (`MeshRenderer` and `LineRenderer`) when disabled. This has been fixed.

### Changes
- The `ARPlaneManager`, `ARPointCloudManager`, and `ARReferencePointManager` all instantiate either prefabs that you specify or `GameObject`s with at least an `ARPlane`, `ARPointCloud`, or `ARReferencePoint`, respectively, on them. The instantiated `GameObject`'s layer was set to match the `ARSessionOrigin`, overwriting the layer specified in the prefab. This has been changed so that if a prefab is specified, no changes to the layer are made. If no prefab is specified, then a new `GameObject` is created, and its layer will match that of the `ARSessionOrigin`'s `GameObject`.

### New
- Added `ARPlane.normal` to get the `ARPlane`'s normal in world space.

### LWRP support
Added LWRP support by allowing `ARCameraBackground` to use a background renderer that overrides the default functionality.  This works in conjunction with some *LWRPSupport* files (see [arfoundation-samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples)) that will live in your LWRP project.

## [1.0.0-preview.17] - 2018-08-02
### Fixes
- Add `FormerlySerializedAs` attribute to serialized field changes to `ARCameraBackground`.

## [1.0.0-preview.16] - 2018-07-26
### Change
- Removed static constructor from `ARSubsystemManager`. This allows access to the manager without forcing the creation of the subsystems, making the initialization more flexible.

## [1.0.0-preview.15] - 2018-07-26
### Fixes
- `ARPlane.vertexChangedThreshold` is no longer allowed to be negative.
- The `ARCameraBackground` component did not reset the projection matrix on disable, leading to stretching or other distortion. This has been fixed.
- The `ARCameraBackground` component did not properly handle an overriden material. This has been fixed (see API Changes below).
- The `ARPlaneMeshGenerators` was meant to generate a triangle fan about the center of the plane. However, indices were instead generated as a fan about one of the bounary points. The visual result is similar, but can lead to long thin triangles. This has been fixed to use the plane's center point as intended.
- Update for compatibility with 2018.3
- If the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer` has a `LineRenderer` on it, then it will be scaled to match the `ARPlane`'s scale, making the visual width invariant under differing `ARSessionOrigin` scales.
- When the `ARPointCloudManager` instantiated a point cloud prefab, it did not change its transform. If it was not identity, then feature points would appear in unexpected places. It now instantiates the point cloud prefab with identity transform.
- The menu item "GameObject > XR > AR Default Point Cloud" created a `GameObject` which used a particle system whose "Scaling Mode" was set to "Local". If used as the `ARPointCloudManager`'s point cloud prefab, this would produce odd results when the `ARSessionOrigin` was scaled. The correct setting is "Hierarchy", and the utility now creates a particle system with the correct setting.

### API Changes
#### ARCameraBackground
The API for overriding the material has been refactored. Previously, a custom material could be set with the `ARCameraBackground.material` setter, but this might be overwritten later if the option to override was disabled.
- Rename: `overrideMaterial` is now `useCustomMaterial`
- New member: `customMaterial`
- The following properties are now private:
    - `material` setter (getter is still public)
    - `backgroundRenderer`

Use the `ARCameraBackground.material` getter to get the currently active material.

## [1.0.0-preview.14] - 2018-07-17
### Fixes
- Fixed a bug in the `ARCameraBackground` which would not render the camera texture properly if the `ARSession` had been destroyed and then recreated or if the `ARCameraBackground` had been disabled and then re-enabled.
- `ARSubsystemManager.systemState`'s setter was not private, allowing user code to change the system state. The setter is now private.
- `ARPlane.trackingState` returned a cached value, which was incorrect if the `ARSession` was no longer active.

### Improvements
- Added `ARSession.Reset()` to destroy the current AR Session and establish a new one. This destroys all trackables, such as planes.
- Added an `ARSubsystemManager.sessionDestroyed` event. The `ARPlaneManager`, `ARPointCloudManager`, and `ARReferencePointManager` subscribe to this event, and they remove their trackables when the `ARSession` is destroyed.

## [1.0.0-preview.13] - 2018-07-03
- Fixed a bug where point clouds did not stop rendering when disabled.
- Added a getter on the `ARPointCloudManager` for the instantiated `ARPointCloud`.
- Added UVs to the `Mesh` generated by the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`.
- Refactored out plane mesh generation functionality into a new static class `ARPlaneMeshGenerators`.
- Added a `meshUpdated` event to the `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`, which lets you customize the generated `Mesh`.
- Added AR Icons.

## [1.0.0-preview.12] - 2018-06-14
- Add color correction value to `LightEstimationData`.

## [1.0.0-preview.11] - 2018-06-08
- Improve lifecycle reporting: remove public members `ARSubsystemManager.availability` and `ARSubsystemManager.trackingState`. Combine with `ARSubsystemManager.systemState` and the public event `ARSubsystemManager.systemStateChanged`.
- Docs improvements
- Move `ParticleSystem` to the top of the `ARDebugPointCloudVisualizer`

## [1.0.0-preview.10] - 2018-06-06

- Update documentation: ARSession image and written description.

## [1.0.0-preview.9] - 2018-06-06

- Rename `ARBackgroundRenderer` to `ARCameraBackground`
- Unify `ARSessionState` & `ARSystemState` enums

## [1.0.0-preview.8] - 2018-05-23
- Change dependency to `ARExtension` 1.0.0-preview.2

## [1.0.0-preview.7] - 2018-05-23
- Remove "timeout" from AR Session
- Add availability and AR install support
- Significant rework to startup lifecycle & asynchronous availability check

## [1.0.0-preview.6] - 2018-04-25

### Rename ARUtilities to ARFoundation

- This package is now called `ARFoundation`.
- Removed `ARPlaceOnPlane`, `ARMakeAppearOnPlane`, `ARPlaneMeshVisualizer`, and `ARPointCloudParticleVisualizer` as these were deemed sample content.
- Removed setup wizard.
- Renamed `ARRig` to `ARSessionOrigin`.
- `ARSessionOrigin` no longer requires its `Camera` to be a child of itself.
